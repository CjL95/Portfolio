Doing this helped me develop soft skills like leadership, communication, and teamwork, and also introduced me to the stress of deadlines, and the burn of 'crunch time'. It also helped me hone my fundamental skills, since I was teaching them to others for several cohorts. Eventually, my skills and experience grew to the point where the organization offered me a position as a part-time employee, and I accepted. As a program assistant, I continue to tutor and train others, but I also develop course materials for all 3 phases of the web design curriculum, as well as assist the program director in refining the structure of the program as a whole. This work is very satisfying and fullfilling. It allows me to not only give back to the organization that trained me, but also to help others improve their own lives.","tenure":"1.5 years","skills":["HTML5","CSS","JavaScript","ReactJS","Wordpress","Linux","Git","PassportJS","MySQL","PHP","Bootstrap","NodeJS","MongoDB","ExpressJS","HandlebarsJS","AWS"]},{"id":"65db68cf3843196a98f23e09","name":"Web Design Contractor","company":"Shiny Red Robot","description":"During my tenure in Code on Point, my mentor wanted to expose me to as much of the field as possible. So he offered me a contract position with his company, Shiny Red Robot. In this position, I was tasked with assisting him in building a custom Wordpress website for a client. I was responsible for designing the front-end of the site around the client's preferences and specifications, while also assisting my mentor in architecting the back-end.

It spans 3 different disciplines: IT, Graphic Design, and Web Development. In the first phase, participants are exposed to all 3, and they close out the phase by working together to create a website. For the next 2 phases of the program, participants can choose a discipline to specialize in, and I chose web development, since my mentor was serving as the instructor. Over my time in the program, I learned how to work in both the MERN stack and the LAMP stack. I learned 3 different programming languages: JavaScript, PHP, and C#. I learned different frameworks, such as HandlebarsJS, ExpressJS, and ReactJS. I learned how to use various tools, such as Git, AWS, Wordpress, MongoDB, IndexedDB, and MySQL. I also learned about different design patterns like MVC and REST, and about coding techniques such as OOP and Functional Programming. But most importantly, I spent 2 years sharpening my problem-solving skills, and learning how to break problems down into single atomic steps.","tenure":"2 years (2020-2022)","skills":["HTML5","CSS","JavaScript","MongoDB","Git","ExpressJS","HandlebarsJS","NodeJS","Bootstrap"]}]}
