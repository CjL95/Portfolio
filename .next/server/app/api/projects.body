I had to add a timer, a pause button, and a radom difficulty button. I also had to modify the assets to include custom sprites. I was able to complete the project in a few days, and I even had extra time to modify the animated background to reflect the difficulty chosen by the user. It was a great introduction to JavaScript and DOM manipulation. I returned to the project in 2023 to refactor and clean up my old code.","contribution":"Front-end Developer","type":"education","skills":["HTML5","CSS","JavaScript"]},{"id":"65db693d3843196a98f23e11","image":"https://portfolio2023bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/","link":"https://github.com/jdavis916/fall2020-final","name":"Carmatch","description":"This was my first final project project in the Code On Point Web Development Program. I worked on it with a team of 6 other students. It was the first full-stack application that I ever contributed to. The project is built with the MERN stack (excluding react) and uses HandlebarsJS as a template engine. It allows users to search for cars based on their preferences. It can also match a car to the user based on how they respond to questions on a personality quiz. I was responsible for leading the back-end development team, which consisted of 2 other students. I delegated tasks to each of us, while also assistng my teammates with the more difficult tasks. I also assisted the front-end team with the polishing and final touches to the user interface.","contribution":"Back-end Lead, Back-end Developer, Front-end Developer","type":"education","skills":["HTML5","CSS","JavaScript","NodeJS","ExpressJS","MongoDB","Bootstrap","Git","Handlebars"]},{"id":"65db693d3843196a98f23e12","image":"https://portfolio2023bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/","link":"https://github.com/jdavis916/sc-proj-insomnia","name":"Project Insomnia","description":"I worked on this with my mentor and my fellow phase 2 Code on Point participants.

This was a MERN application (excluding react) using HandebarsJS as a template engine. It was made to be a futuristic ride share service with a user account system that offered rides in self-driving cars. It was inspired by sites like Uber and Lyft. I served as Project Manager, Back-end Lead, and Git Master for this project, and was responsible for interfacing with a mock client for style and general design direction, assigning tasks to back-end team members in order to ensure completion of the minimum viable product (MVP), and assisting team members on both ends with tasks, especially the back-end team.

It is an online simulator for the MMORPG game World of Warcraft. It determines how much damage per second a certain class of character can deal out, based on their equipment, talents, what they are fighting, and the length of the fight. It was intended to be a tool to help players make educated decisions in-game about what items to seek out. I created the front-end GUI, while my teammates were responsible for coding the simulator and building the back-end. It is a Flask app built with vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap on the front-end, with the backend written in Python. Though most of my work involved the standard front-end technologies I had worked with before, I did occasionally have to tweak the Python back-end to accept input properly from the front-end. It was my first time working with Flask, and my first time working with Python outside of college. It was also my first time working on a project that was not for school or work.","contribution":"Front-end Developer","type":"community","skills":["HTML5","CSS","JavaScript","Python","Flask","Bootstrap","Git","Anaconda"]},{"id":"65db693d3843196a98f23e17","image":"https://portfolio2023bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/","link":"https://github.com/jdavis916/winter2021-final","name":"Roar Project","description":"This was a site that I helped my mentor build for a client of his company, Shiny Red Robot.

At first, I made it by following directions from a tutorial on web scraping, and it did what I needed it to. But when I needed to use it again a bit later, I wasn't able to, since it had been hard coded to scrape a specific site with a specific structure. Also, my skills had grown to the point that I could see how verbose and awkward that solution was overall, so I rewrote the tool in Typescript from scratch, with an emphasis on keeping it lean and dynamic so it can be used again.","contribution":"Back-end Developer","type":"tool","skills":["Typescript","NodeJS","Git","Axios","Cheerio"]},{"id":"65db693d3843196a98f23e19","image":"https://portfolio2023bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/","link":"https://github.com/CjL95/Portfolio","name":"Portfolio Website","description":"The site you're visiting right now!
